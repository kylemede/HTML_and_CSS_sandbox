# HTML_and_CSS_sandbox
A sandbox to host some of the key HTML and CSS tricks I have used to build another site that could be useful to others.

These include:
- A hotizontally centered and evenly spaced list of links.
- A marquee made with pure HTML and CSS3 with images and text.
- A circle of spinning text made with pure HTML and CSS3.  It becomes visible, expands and starts spinning after being hovered over.  Great for header menu items, or just for fun.  You can also ignore the first stages activating the CSS with hovering, and just make a static spinning circle of text.

More to come, just all I had time to generalize so far.
